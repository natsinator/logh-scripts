OPENING THEME
"Skies of Love"

NARRATOR
In one small part of space, the war continues. 
In war, there can be only one victor. Space is an uninhabited wilderness and bloody wounds disappear with time.Maybe the multitude of stars in the sky remember those wounds.Maybe it is fated that even those stars will vanish one day.
Man's presence in the midst of these stars is all that remains of a forgotten battle.
At this time, in the middle of the universe, an insignificant island, a galaxy, was at war.
The combatants are the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance. 
Also, trading with both sides, is the small city-state of Phezzan, a feudal territory. Remaining neutral in the war, it watches both sides battle. 
The war has already been going on for 150 years.

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
Looking at the stars?

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
The stars are good.
Unmoving, they keep watch over us, forever shining, the only constant left to us.

Captain Siegfried Kircheis

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
Our battles are insignificant compared to that vastness.

High Admiral Reinhard von Lohengramm

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Certainly, compared to what we see, ours is but a small war.
And... 

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
The enemy's forces outnumber us two to one, and surround us on three sides. Therefore, all five admirals have been desperately seeking an audience with Your Excellency.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
It doesn't surprise me that those silly old men have lost their nerve.

MERKATZ
Your Excellency, thank you for granting us an audience.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
I am already aware of your views, gentlemen. You believe we face disaster, right?

ID CARD
Vice Admiral Staaden

STAADEN
The truth is, the enemy does have us at a great disadvantage.
At the very least, we must develop a new strategy to minimize the damage.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
In other words, you want us to withdraw. But that is exactly what we must not do. I will not even consider a retreat.

STAADEN
But why? Surely you can give us a reason.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Because, despite all appearances, we hold the upper hand!

ADRIAN RUBINSKY
This is just one of many battles which we must concede to the Alliance. The final victor is still undecided. The clouds of war simply won't clear. For the time being, our territory, Phezzan is a mere onlooker. But if the Empire and the Alliance get tired of war, our Phezzan will make a profit.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Now, we will advance. This is the plan I have approved.

STAADEN
That's just supposition! Your Excellency, it can't succeed...

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Enough!
You are all under my command.
If you do not obey these orders, then I, acting under Imperial military law will relieve you of your duties, and see that you are punished.
Enough. Dismissed. This discussion is over.

STAADEN
That conceited blond brat...

Rear Admiral Erlache

ERLACHE
He's just using his sister's relationship with His Majesty to further his career.

MERKATZ
It's his youth. Even though he's now a man, he still acts like a child.

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
Was that wise? Saying that...

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Forget it. Their attitude will change when we win.

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
Today's your sister's birthday.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
I mustn't forget. Our victory today will be her birthday present.

The report says the Alliance forces are twice that of ours.

KAISER FRIEDRICH
Will we lose this time?

LICHTENLADE
That is definitely possible.

KAISER FRIEDRICH
I see. The commander of the subjugation forces is her little brother, isn't he?

LICHTENLADE
The heir to the name of Count Lohengramm is fighting at the front?
Rather a bad state of affairs...

Sieg, take care of Reinhard, won't you?

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
Okay.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Don't worry so. We'll win. But...

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
Are you worried about something?

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
There is one problem.

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
Yes?

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
That enemy soldier.

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
The one called the "Hero of El Facil."

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Yes.

Vice Admiral Paeta

PAETA
Commodore Yang Wenli, at your request, we have read this plan. However, it seems to be overly cautious.
We're more than a match for the enemy. We have twice as many ships.This is not a time to worry about defeat. It's a time for fighting. Why, after all this time, should we worry about losing?

ID CARD
Commodore Yang Wenli

YANG WENLI
But we don't know what will happen on the battlefield. We can't afford to be careless.

PAETA
At any rate, all present agree. This plan is turned down. 
Go. But there's no reason to give up on you.

YANG WENLI
Those words are praise enough.
Well, then...

DUSTY ATTENBOROUGH
Again?

YANG WENLI
It was my bad luck to have those instructors. My presentation did not go well.

ID CARD
Commander Dusty Attenborough

DUSTY ATTENBOROUGH
It can't be helped. They're very stubborn because of their age.

YANG WENLI
True. We don't like to grow old, do we?

DUSTY ATTENBOROUGH
But, leaving it up to old fogies? We'll win this time, won't we?

YANG WENLI
Superior numbers. Victory's been promised.
But... 

DUSTY ATTENBOROUGH
But?

YANG WENLI
That fellow... the enemy commander.

DUSTY ATTENBOROUGH
Reinhard von Lohengramm. One of their High Admirals?

YANG WENLI
Yes, the commander of the white ship. I don't know what he'll do.

DUSTY ATTENBOROUGH
I'm not looking forward to going to the afterlife.

YANG WENLI
Right. So I won't take my eyes off him.
But the commander turned down my plan...
Well, shall we go?

DUSTY ATTENBOROUGH
Let me see it.

YANG WENLI
What's the point?

STOCKHAUSEN
Our fleet at Astate is scarcely 20,000.

SEECKT
This time, we'll see that impudent blond brat humiliated.

STOCKHAUSEN
But he...maybe he'll repel the enemy with some strange plan again.

SEECKT
But his current fleet is not the same one that did so well before.

STOCKHAUSEN
Meaning?

SEECKT
The staff officers who helped him out with personnel matters aren't participating this time. One man can't win the war.
Being a good staff officer, he will win if he executes his plan correctly.

STOCKHAUSEN
Whereupon, he will appear very good because he wouldn't accept anything less than total victory.

SEECKT
But you won't hear talk of winning, right?

LOUDSPEAKER
The enemy's strength at Astate has been announced as twice that of our forces. Let's anticipate victory for our Imperial Forces...

REUENTHAL
You've been separated from him for four months?

MITTERMEYER
Don't talk about the military's personnel actions, OK?
Well, none of the others will be under him, either.

ID CARD
Vice Admiral Oskar von Reuental

REUENTHAL
Yes. Now, just the redhead will be so lucky.
Can he survive without us?

ID CARD
Vice Admiral Wolfgang Mittermeyer

MITTERMEYER
Regardless, we can't help him from here.
It's OK. He'll surely win.

REUENTHAL
Yes. I hope so, too.

ID CARD
Captain Paul von Oberstein

LOUDSPEAKER
The Battle of Astate will begin soon.

RUBINSKY
(Laughs)

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
All ships, advance towards the enemy.

LOUDDSPEAKER
Contrary to expectations, the Imperial Forces will engage the 4th Fleet.

PAETA
What?! That's absurd! It's impossible!

YANG WENLI
If I were him, I would have considered doing the same thing.

DUSTY ATTENBOROUGH
It's not your fault. You tried to tell them.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
All ships! Frontal attack on the enemy!

DUSTY ATTENBOROUGH
(Reading Yang's plan)
If the enemy has good morale, I don't think this'll take too long. I think there's a good chance they'll crush each of our separate forces.

DUSTY ATTENBOROUGH
The enemy was thinking of that, after all. A counter for this...

YANG WENLI
Even if you read it, it's no use. It's already too late to use that plan.
But there's still another way...
Only, if we don't do it, 20,000 ships... Maybe even 40,000 ships will be destroyed.
That's not going to hurt the enemy very much.

LOUDSPEAKER
Enemy fleet total: 13,000.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
It's simply a matter of numbers. Isn't it just a matter of time until we win?

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
Yes, as you say.

PAETA (internally)
The plan to envelop the enemy with 40,000... If attacked individually, each separate fleet is 13,000.
20,000 against 13,000...
Our side will definitely lose.

PASTOLL
What's the meaning of this?! Counterattack!
All ships, prepare for battle!
Launch all Spartanian ships!

LOUDSPEAKER
They're already under heavy attack!
There's no time to launch!
4th Fleet carriers under fire from heavy weapons!
Launching is impossible!
Because the enemy's jamming communications, the situation's unknown beyond that!

PAETA
What a mess!
With the fighters stuck inside, we're just sitting ducks!
2nd Fleet, prepare to launch all fighters!

POPLAN
We're saved! We can get out!

KONEV
Well, outside or not, the situation's impossible!

POPLAN
But forget about dying in a ship like this.

ID CARD

LOUDSPEAKER
2nd Fleet, preparations for fighter launch complete.

PAETA
Good! The 2nd Fleet will go to the 4th Fleet's aid!

YANG WENLI
Please wait!
The battle's already ending! The enemy's leaving.
They're moving to the rear faster than the 2nd and 6th Fleets and risking a counterattack. This gives us the upper hand.
However, there's nothing we can do about the present situation. I don't think we need to anticipate the enemy's plans more than this.

PAETA
Well, then give me your recommendations.

YANG WENLI
Join with the 6th Fleet. 
First of all, we'll take a shortcut to join them as soon as possible. When the 2nd and 6th Fleets are combined, we'll have 26,000 ships. With 6000 more than the enemy, we can force a draw.

PAETA
So you're saying we should abandon the 4th Fleet?

YANG WENLI
No matter how you put it, we don't have time. This is a vast universe. How many hours do you think it'll take to get to them?

PAETA
But we can't abandon our allies.

YANG WENLI
If we don't, we'll all end up victims of the enemy's plan to crush us individually.

PAETA
And so it can't be helped, even if the 4th Fleet ends up helplessly broken. 
If they're holding out...

YANG WENLI
I told you a little while ago that it's hopeless.

PAETA
Vice Admiral Pastoll, the commander of the 4th Fleet. He's my friend. He's an experienced commander of 100 battles. There's no reason to believe he'll be easily beaten.
Enough, Commodore. We will not abandon our allies.

YANG WENLI
I guess friendship is important.
I also have a friend in the 6th Fleet and I don't wish to abandon him.
I also have another in the 2nd Fleet.
Even if we lose the 4th Fleet...

LOUDSPEAKER
The condition of the 4th Fleet is unknown.

PAETA
There is more hope than not.
The 2nd Fleet will head for the 4th Fleet and go to its aid.
Understood?

YANG WENLI
If that's your command, then this is not my time.
Well...

YANG WENLI
It's become an awkward situation.
I must think of one more plan. At least, a means to stay alive.

DUSTY ATTENBOROUGH
Because we're going to the rescue, we'll be defeated twice. It's like an uphill battle.

YANG WENLI
That brings me to the 6th Fleet once more.
The operations staff officer from the same class as mine. He's a brilliant guy.

DUSTY ATTENBOROUGH
You mean Lap?

YANG WENLI
Yes. If we can avoid his superior officer, I should be able to get his opinions.
He thinks somewhat differently from me, you see...

What? Lt Commander Lap, what did you just say?

ID CARD
Lt Commander Jean Robert Lap

JEAN ROBERT LAP
Sir, in my humble opinion, the 4th Fleet is already beaten.

SIXTH FLEET COMMANDER
Are you saying we should abandon the 4th Fleet?

JEAN ROBERT LAP
Yes. In addition, we should join with the 2nd Fleet as soon as possible.

SIXTH FLEET COMMANDER
And by that time, the 4th Fleet will be massacred, won't it?

JEAN ROBERT LAP
Even so, there's no time.
The enemy will destroy us, right before our eyes.

SIXTH FLEET COMMANDER
Destroy us?!
We'll destroy them!
We'll go to the aid of the 4th Fleet!

JEAN ROBERT LAP
Yes, sir. I'm sorry for that silly idea.
If I were Yang, what would I do?

MERKATZ (Over video call)
The fighting is over. It's a total victory. From now on, it's simply slaughter.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
That's unnecessary.

MERKATZ
Ah?

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
We should ignore the enemy wounded.
The enemy still has two fleets. The best way to use our strength is to prepare for the next battle.

MERKATZ
Understood, Your Excellency.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Their attitude has changed a little.

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
It can't help but change, I suppose. And the Admirals' hostility, too.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Which fleet do you think will attack next, Kircheis?

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
The left one or the right? Although it could go either way, you always know.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Well then, how much time until then?

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
Four hours.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
You...You've seen it, too, haven't you?
Then pass the command to all ships. Change course and proceed in a clockwise direction towards the enemy's 6th Fleet.

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
Very well.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Do you object?

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
No, it's not that, but we can use this time. How about letting the soldiers take a rest?

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Oh, yes, I didn't notice. The timing?

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
In two 1 1/2 hour shifts.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Yes.

TONIO
Maybe we're lucky after all.

KURT
Yes. Our young commander will do pretty well. 
But the war still goes on for us mere soldiers. In order to stay alive, we have to rest when we can.

TONIO
A lot of wounded.

KURT
Nowadays, you don't die unless you're hurt pretty bad.
My arm's like this.
But in this war, with one hit, it's boom. So there are far more wounded.
Who knows whether we'll live or die?
Well, let's get some sleep.

TONIO
But in the tank bed, it's just one hour of sleep, isn't it?

KURT
In one hour it can take away the fatigue like eight hours of ordinary sleep.

TONIO
It just takes away the fatigue. There's no time to dream!

KURT
There's no need to dream during a war.
At any rate, you'd only have nightmares.

LOUDSPEAKER
We've contacted the enemy 6th Fleet!

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Commence attack!

LOUDSPEAKER
Ships detected at 4:30!

SIXTH FLEET COMMANDER
4:30?!

JEAN ROBERT LAPP
It's the enemy! Prepare a counterattack!

SIXTH FLEET COMMANDER
In the confusion, the enemy arrived. They can't be in that direction.

JEAN ROBERT LAPP
But they are, Admiral. The enemy probably moved the battlefield.

SIXTH FLEET COMMANDER
They didn't attack the 4th Fleet?

JEAN ROBERT LAPP
I already told you! The 4th Fleet is defeated!

SIXTH FLEET COMMANDER
Don't say unpleasant things! 

JEAN ROBERT LAPP
The truth is very unpleasant!

LOUDSPEAKER
Enemy attack!

SIXTH FLEET COMMANDER
Return fire! Turn and return fire!

JEAN ROBERT LAPP
You mustn't! It's plain to see that they'll win!
We have to reduce our losses, even a little!

SIXTH FLEET COMMANDER
Shut up!
I won't retreat like a coward!

JEAN ROBERT LAPP
Yang...don't end up like this...
Jessica, I won't see you again, either...
I'll vanish here.
Forgive...

LOUDSPEAKER
The 6th Fleet is destroyed.

PAETA
What?!

YANG WENLI
Lt Commander Lap...

DUSTY ATTENBOROUGH
Even though he was good, he was wasted under an incompetent commander.

LOUDSPEAKER
Enemy fleet, contacting our fleet.

PAETA
Now, without the 4th and the 6th Fleets besides being outnumbered, our position's hopeless.

YANG WENLI
Admiral, prepare all ships to attack!

PAETA
O...oh, that's right...

YANG (Internally)
Lap, I won't be beaten so easily.

MERKATZ (Over video call)
Victory is already certain.

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Don't let up until it's over. We still don't know what will happen.
If he is in that fleet...

SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS
Commodore Yang Wenli?

REINHARD VON LOHENGRAMM
Yes. As you say.

NARRATOR
Even while saying that, the man Reinhard who will later be called invincible, was almost convinced.
